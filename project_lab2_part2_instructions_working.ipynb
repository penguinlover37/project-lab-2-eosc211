    "Yes, this makes sense. A steeper subduction plate is generally correlated with shallower earthquake depths, while a less steep angle is correlated with deeper earthquake depths. This is reflected in the plot, where the trend of earthquake depths increases in the x-axis area of the shallower slope. Curiously, steeper slopes theoretically lead to higher seismic activity and more frequency earthquakes, but this plot represents the opposite effect."
